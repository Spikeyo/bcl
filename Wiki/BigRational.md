## BigRational
BigRational builds on the [BigInteger](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger(VS.100).aspx) introduced in .NET Framework 4 to create an arbitrary-precision rational number type.  A rational number is a ratio between two integers, and in this implementation BigIntegers are used for the numerator and denominator.

### Getting started

[release:Download](42782)
You can download the BigRational library and a sample command-line application that reads two rationals and an operator and then prints the result.
[Class Reference](BigRational-Class-Reference.md)
The class reference lists all of the public functionality on the BigRational type and relevant comments about each.
